# Eliza Python implementation
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
This is a Python implementation of one of the most know chatbots.
I first played with Eliza en a C64 many years ago and coded on C and later CPP but to be hones, Python is really powerfull to handle data make things easier.
In the docs folder there are other implementatios as reference so it is possible to compare how much you get using the right tool for the right job.

## The CS50 Final Project

Being this thedeliverable for the Final Project, lets complete the requirements here:

- What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?


- What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

- If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

- In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?
