# Eliza Python implementation
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
This is a Python implementation of one of the most know chatbots.
I first played with Eliza en a C64 many years ago and coded on C and later CPP and Java but to be honest, Python is really powerfull to handle data make things easier.
In the docs folder there are other implementatios as reference so it is possible to compare how much you get using the right tool for the right job.

## The CS50 Final Project

Being this the deliverable for the Final Project, lets complete the requirements:

### What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This is an implementation of the Eliza chatboch. It simulates the interaction with a psichoanalyst so, the bot do questions and you will answer.
The bot will try to identify keywords on your input to create a contextual dialogue.
To execute it be sure you have a valid Python installation on your computer and run:

`python eliza.py`

or

`python3 eliza.py`

depending on how you configured your environment on the root folder.


### What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I never coded much on Python and the main challenge was to identify the language features to allow me a cleaner implementation.



### If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

Just me.


### In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

I must work on a tight schedule so I needed to balance the scope of the deliverable.
